            Since i was young i was fascinated by computers and technology, i
            remember the first time we got a computer, you can say it wes love
            at first sight. I found myself spending hours and hours playing
            games, searching and learning anything i can about new programs, and
            dreaming about being a hacker like you see in the movies. When i got
            older i was really mesmerized about web and web design, so i decided
            to write my first web page when i was 12 years of age. I didn't know
            much, so i had gone to websites, open their code and just copy/paste
            what i liked to make it my own, it was the early 2000 so no Youtube
            and no tutorials in my grasp, and writing Html wasn't as easy as it
            is today. At the end it was a nice working web page with some
            Java-script features, i can say i was pretty proud about it as much
            as a 12 year old boy can be. In my teen years while having my
            matriculation in computer science i found love in the preforming
            arts and decided that music is my goal. I went to Muzik collage of
            music and had my degree, while i worked in the food industry, as a
            waiter, manager and anything you can think of, at the best
            restaurants in Tel-Aviv. Fast forward to 2021, Covid emerge and
            something in me changed, and i decided to go back to my first
            childhood love, i went to Coding-Academy and finished a boot-camp
            course in web design and i found my passion for coding once more.
            Now i am happy to say that i found my goal of becoming a great
            programmer.
